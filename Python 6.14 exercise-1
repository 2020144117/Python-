Exercise 5: Take the following Python code that stores a string:

str 'X-DSPAM-Conf idence:0.8475

Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the colon characterand then use the float function
to convert the extracted string into a floating point number

str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'

str = str.split(':')[1]
result = float(str)
print(result)
